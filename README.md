# A Mobile App for Lottery Addiction

This project is a guided project from [dataquest.io](https://dataquest.io), creating python functions for a fictituous mobile app company wanting to help lottery addiction.

In this project, we will build functions that enable users to answer questions about the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) like:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or 4, 3, or 2) winning numbers on a single ticket?

We will also include historical data coming from the [national 6/49 lottery game in Canada from 1982 to 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset).
